# drop

drop is a simple function to inspect one or more variables in a PHP script
and halt execution of that script. When debugging, I've found it helpful to
simply kill a script and expose the actual type/contents or a var.

# usage

In your script simply call drop($var[, $var[, ...]]);

# installation

Using [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) `"require" : { "henderjon/drop": "1.*" }`
