# drop

drop is a simple function to inspect one or more variables in a PHP script
and halt execution of that script. When debugging, I've found it helpful to
simply kill a script and expose the actual type/contents or a var.

# Usage

In your script simply call drop($var[, $var[, ...]]);

# Installation

Install the [Packagist archive](https://packagist.org/packages/henderjon/drop)
using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

drop is also included in [Chevron](https://github.com/henderjon/chevron).
